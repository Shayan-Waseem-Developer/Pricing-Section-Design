This project is a responsive pricing section built using only HTML and CSS. The goal of this project was to practice creating clean layouts, working with typography, spacing, and colors, and making the design responsive across different screen sizes.

Features

Three pricing cards (Basic, Standard, Premium)

Clear call-to-action buttons

Responsive design that adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop

Hover effects for interactivity

Built using semantic HTML and modern CSS practices (Flexbox + Media Queries)

Why I Built This Project

I created this project as part of my web development practice to strengthen my skills in:

Structuring HTML with a focus on clarity and reusability

Styling with CSS variables for consistent design

Using Flexbox for alignment and layout

Applying media queries to make designs mobile-friendly

How It Works

On larger screens, the pricing plans are displayed side by side. 

On tablet & mobile, the layout stacks vertically for easy readability.
